# WordMail

WordMail is a Telegram bot that helps you generate formal emails with the help of OpenAI. Simply provide a short subject, and WordMail will create a professional email for you!



## Usage

To use WordMail, you will need to create a Telegram bot and obtain an API token. You can follow the instructions [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) to create your bot and get your API token.
Once you have your API token, you can run WordMail. Send the subject to the bot directly or add it to a channel or group so it can listen for messages and respond.


## Limitations

Please note that WordMail is still in development, and may not work perfectly for all use cases. Additionally, WordMail uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API, which has a limited number of free requests per month. If you use WordMail frequently, you may need to obtain your own API key from OpenAI.
